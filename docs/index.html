        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <p>
        This is an iOS8 class. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin.iOS development environment with either a configured iOS Simulator or a device to run the exercise on. Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
        </p>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>
		<p>
			Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS350/">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/IOS350/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<div class="objective">Quick look at new frameworks (PhotoKit and Touch ID)</div>
				We will go through two samples showing off the new PhotoKit API which allows you to examine photos which are stored on the device, and the new Touch ID local authentication features which use the touch id sensor. Both samples are included with the lab content.
			</li>

			<li>
				<div class="objective">Working with some of the new UIKit changes in iOS8</div>
				<a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
				<br />
				In this first exercise, you will modify an existing application to utilize some of the new features in UIKit such as the <code>UISearchController</code>, new navigation features, and new <code>UITableView</code> capabilities.
			</li>

			<li>
				<div class="objective">Working with Unified Storyboards in Visual Studio</div>
				In this group exercise, we will check out the new unified storyboard support that has been added to XCode and Visual Studio. Together, we will turn on the size class support and show how we can utilize a single storyboard to target different device types and orientations.
			</li>
		</ol>
